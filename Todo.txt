Ideas, next feature sets and bugs
----------------------------------

Todo
-----
* concisely organized demos and a documentation page
* document browser support
* fix up headers with ellipses and white-space, overflow
* settings - doc which can be changed, which can't once the grid is loaded. use internal
    structure to hold instead of relying on passed in settings object
* shouldn't need selectableRows to set keyField
* packagers

Ideas
------
* customize item/model name
* option to show empty rows or not
* remove jQuery dependency
* allow custom per page options [10,20,30]
* per column searcher not just one for whole grid
* ajax demo
* determine if a browser supports n-th child so we don't need to spit out gdl-col-N classes
* should we add custom formatters to griddl.formatter instead of adding to column? Then assign formatter 'name' to column
     this will promote reuse of formattes but is it necessary?
* Should columns always start at asc when you first sort? Use case; sort a col, then sort another, then go back to original

Potential Road map
--------------------
* 1.0.0 Initial release
* 1.1.0 incorporate search in ui
* 1.2.0 per column searching
* 1.?.0 remove jQuery dependency
